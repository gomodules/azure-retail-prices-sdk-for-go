# azure-retail-prices-sdk-for-go

- [Azure Retail Prices overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cost-management/retail-prices/azure-retail-prices)

The official [azure-sdk-for-go](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go) does not support the retail prices api. Once https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/issues/20295 is resolved, it will be better to use the official api client.
